About:
Decentralized Ticketmaster alternative with limits to resale price, tickets per wallet and royalties on resold tickets for the venue and band. This is to put more money into the artists and venues with less overall fees. It is also to limit the "Taylor Swift" effect of bots buying a bunch of tickets and reselling them for an outragously higher rate
